# Scenarios for Nutanix X-Ray
Scenarios are the core of Nutanix X-Ray. They enable a reproducable sequence of events that make up a test against a virtualized system. Scenarios are implemented using YAML to describe the events and leverage additional files, such as those from fio, to execute workloads.

This repository includes the scenario implementations made available in Nutanix X-Ray. To learn more about X-Ray check out http://www.nutanix.com/xray
